2. Installing Node using NVM
Install the latest version of node.js. Here node is the alias for the latest version.

nvm install --lts



3. Working with NVM
You can use the following command to list installed versions of the node for the current user.
nvm ls 

With this command, you can find the available node.js version for the installation.

You can also select a different version for the current session. The selected version will be the currently active version for the current shell only.
nvm use 18.16.0 

To find the default Node version set for the current user, type:

You can run a Node script with the desired version of node.js using the below command:
nvm exec 18.16.0 server.js 


4. Uninstall Node Version
To uninstall a specific Node.js version, use the nvm uninstall command followed by the version number. You can find the installed versions using `nvm ls` command. For example, if you want to uninstall Node.js version 18.16.0, run the following command:
nvm uninstall 18.16.0
